                Last night, Elon Musk suggested that Earth is simply a 
                simulation from an alien race’s video game. Why would Musk say this? 
                Because he is one of those aliens.
                It’s easy to get a kick out of Musk’s quirky quotables. 
                But the closer you look at his words and actions, the more you’ll start to see: 
                He’s an alien who came from another galaxy to help save humanity. Here’s proof.
